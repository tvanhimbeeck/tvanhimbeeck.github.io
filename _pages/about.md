<!-- intro: Welcome to my academic webpage !   -->

I'm a researcher in the field of quantum information theory at Télécom Paris.

The promise of our field is to bring new technologies to the table such as *quantum cryptography* and *quantum computing*. But a mayor question is how to actually realize these objectives in practice with current and future quantum hardware. My research therefore aims to bridge the gap between theory and experiments, by improving the theory side and developing new mathematical tools that are more general and are better compatible with practical technologies.

My research is focused on the interplay between *information theory* and *optimisation*. Together they form a modern and powerful toolbox that can be applied to quantum information theory. 

I have extensive experience in *quantum cryptography*, such as quantum key distribution, finite-size security proofs, (semi-)device-independent protocols, coin-flipping and quantum optics.
